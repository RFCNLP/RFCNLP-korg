# Korg Installation Instructions

* TOC
{:toc}

## Instructions

We have tried to make this easy by providing the installation script [`setup.sh`](../setup.sh).  

* Note: this script assumes `Python3` is already globally installed.

However, if this does not work for you, then:

1. Install <a href="https://www.spinroot.com">Spin</a> *globally*.  So, you should be able to run it from the command line from anywhere in your computer.
	
	* An easy way to confirm this is to run `spin` from some arbitrary folder in the command line, and see if something sensible happens! 

2. Make sure you have `Python3` installed.

	* An easy way to confirm this is to run `echo "print('awesome')" | python3` from some arbitrary folder in the command line, and see if the resulting output is, indeed, `awesome`.

3. `pip3 install green` so the tests will run correctly from the `Makefile`.

4. If somehow `make` is not installed on your system, consider installing it so you can use the `Makefile`!

5. Then to confirm everything is up and running, try `make test`, and see if you get a ton of output ending with confirmation that the tests passed!

	* See the example output at the bottom of this page.

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at maxvonhippel@gmail.com, or, open up an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/maxvonhippel/AttackerSynthesis/issues).
